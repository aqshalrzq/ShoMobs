# ShoMobs - Flutter Project
Hello everyone, how are you?
May this new year bring you more happiness from God.

This time I want to show off a mobile-based application project that I am working on. This app is called ShoMobs.

This app was developed with Flutter with a case study of creating dashboard displays for clothing purchases.

### ShoMobs - Technology
There are several packages that I used while developing the ShoMobs app. All of them are available on the pub.dev website with the following details:
[google_fonts](https://pub.dev/packages/google_fonts)
[simple_animation](https://pub.dev/packages/simple_animations)

### ShoMobs - About
The ShoMobs project directory consists of 3 packages and 1 main.dart file as a starting point. Every package that I make I make a supporting component when creating a dashboard view with the details of the package I made:
- animation
- component
- page

### ShoMobs - Open Source
For those of you who want to develop this ShoMobs application even better, I invite you with a note that your goal is for good. Besides, if you really want to make this app commercial, please contact me.
